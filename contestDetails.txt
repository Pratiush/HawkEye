Try imporving the application
Some things that can be done:
> Try adding more information regarding nodes in the list. Like open ports and services
> You can definitely use concepts of OOPs here
> Try adding a GUI Interface to the application
> You can also show active nodes in the form of GUI and incorporate nodes from other subnet and show
  connections among them.
> You are allowed to add any other feature you want.  
> In case you are not comfortable with python, you are allowed to use another language. Simply output the result (like IPs and MACs) to an external file and use another language to build the improved application.
